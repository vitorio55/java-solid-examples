<h2>Java Examples for S.O.L.I.D. Principles</h2>
This examples project is divided in packages that exemplify S.O.L.I.D. principles.<br/>
S.O.L.I.D. stands for:
* Single Responsibility Principle
* Open for Extension / Closed for Modification Principle
* Liskov Substitution Principle
* Interface Segregation Principle
* Dependency Inversion Principle

The <strong>Liskov Substitution Principle</strong> is the only example that uses <strong>Unit Tests</strong> instead of a class in src/.</br>
Make sure you run those tests to understand the functionality.
</br></br>
To run all examples at once, simply run the <strong>Main</strong> class.
